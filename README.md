## What this is

This is a simple project I started to measure my long term subjective well being.

*It is currently not working.*

# How to use it

Once this is finished, you'll want to run tracker.py throughout the day and the email script weekly, both as cronjobs. There will be a file in my .gitignore to post your email address in.
